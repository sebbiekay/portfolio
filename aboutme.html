    <h3>I'm Sebastian. I like to make stuff.</h3>
    <p>
      One of the coolest things about being a person on the internet is that you can
      explore and combine your hobbies and passions and learn more about them as
      you practice. That's what I'm doing here.
    <br>
    I'm a lifelong learner and aspiring software developer with over 10 years of experience as a freelancer and an entrepreneurial spirit.
    Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming. I got my start doing graphics, illustration,
    and front-end web design for friends, hence my flair for interesting and quirky design choices. </p>
    <h3>Self taught and self motivated.</h3>
    <p>
      My plans for the future are filled to the brim with new challenges and experiences.
